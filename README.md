## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This exercise was a great way to work on my basic HTML and CSS skills. 
I was able to use Flexbox and Grid witch are some of the best tools at our disposal to create responsive websites. 

### Continued development

I would like to add an animation to reduce the size of the QR code when the user does not hover over it.
